# Go Hexagonal Architecture Guide

Code authoring guide for the roth-converter Go backend, which follows
hexagonal (ports/adapters) architecture.

> sections later in this file were imported from a sibling Go project
> (a trading system) and use trading-domain examples (broker, AVWAP,
> backtest). The Go-language patterns they describe (concurrent map

## Dependency Rules

```
domain ← ports ← adapters
                ← app (services depend on port interfaces)
```

- `domain/` — no external imports (stdlib only)
- `ports/` — imports `domain/` only
- `adapters/` — imports `ports/` + `domain/`, provides concrete implementations
- `app/` — imports `ports/` + `domain/`, never references adapters directly

## New Feature Patterns

### 1. New Domain Entity
```go
// domain/new_entity.go
type MyEntity struct {
    ID   uuid.UUID
    Name string
}

func NewMyEntity(name string) (MyEntity, error) {
    if name == "" {
        return MyEntity{}, errors.New("name must not be empty")
    }
    return MyEntity{ID: uuid.New(), Name: name}, nil
}
```

### 2. New Port Interface
```go
// ports/my_port.go
type MyPort interface {
    DoSomething(ctx context.Context, id uuid.UUID) (domain.MyEntity, error)
}
```

### 3. New Adapter
```go
// adapters/myadapter/myadapter.go
type Adapter struct {
    cfg config.Config
    log zerolog.Logger
}

func New(cfg config.Config, log zerolog.Logger) *Adapter {
    return &Adapter{
        cfg: cfg,
        log: log.With().Str("component", "myadapter").Logger(),
    }
}

func (a *Adapter) DoSomething(ctx context.Context, in domain.MyEntity) (domain.Result, error) {
    // implementation
}
```

### 4. New HTTP Handler
```go
// adapters/http/my_handler.go
type MyHandler struct {
    svc ports.MyPort  // depends on port interface
    log zerolog.Logger
}

func (h *MyHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // struct json tags define the API contract
}
```

### 5. New Service
```go
// app/myfeature/service.go
type Service struct {
    repo ports.MyPort
    bus  ports.EventBusPort
    log  zerolog.Logger
}
```

### 6. Wiring (app/service.go)
- `Wire(cfg, log) (*Service, cleanup, error)` — composes the tax-tables
  repo, the matrix calculator (solver), and any future adapters into a
  single `Service` value. `cmd/roth-server/main.go` calls this once at
  startup, hands the result to `router.New`, and listens on the
  configured port.

## Coding Conventions

### Error Wrapping
```go
return fmt.Errorf("myservice: save entity: %w", err)
```

### Structured Logging
```go
log := log.With().Str("component", "my_service").Logger()
log.Info().Str("symbol", sym.String()).Msg("processing")
```

### Test Pattern
```go
func TestMyEntity(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"valid", "test", false},
        {"empty name", "", true},
    }
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            _, err := domain.NewMyEntity(tt.input)
            if tt.wantErr {
                require.Error(t, err)
            } else {
                require.NoError(t, err)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Repo-specific test gotchas

Before writing a new `_test.go` in this repo, lock in these conventions:

- **Module path is `github.com/ridopark/roth-converter/backend`.** Not `ridopark/roth-converter`. Sub-agents often guess the latter from the repo URL; verify with a `head backend/go.mod` first.
- **Default to internal-package tests (`package foo`, NOT `package foo_test`)** when the test needs unexported types, fields, or methods. Most `app/...` tests do this — `repeg_dup_guard_test.go`, `multi_fill_test.go`, `reconcile_fills_test.go` are all `package execution`. The external `_test` package is reserved for thin "library API" tests.
- **Reuse the package's existing test fixtures.** Before hand-rolling stub repos / brokers, grep the package for `noopBroker`, `mockBroker`, `trackingBroker`, `capturingRepo`, `reconcileFillsRepo`, `multiFillRepo`. They satisfy the wide `ports.RepositoryPort` / `ports.BrokerPort` surfaces and are extendable via embedding.
- **Pre-commit hooks block compile-failing commits in this repo.** A pure RED commit (tests reference symbols that do not exist yet) cannot be landed by itself — the lint/typecheck hook rejects it before the commit lands. Two options:
  1. **Combine RED + GREEN in one commit.** Write the test first, verify it fails as expected in-session, then add the production stub and commit both together. This is the pattern Phase 1's `recordFillsFromExecHistory` used.
  2. **Land an empty stub of the production symbol first** (returns nil / zero value) so RED can compile and fail by assertion, then GREEN replaces the stub.
  Never `--no-verify` to bypass the hook.
- **For sub-agent dispatch (tdd-red, etc.)**: include the module path, the target test package (internal vs external), and the nearest neighbor test file the agent should copy. Agents that probe via reflection waste context; agents that copy proven fixtures land working code first try.

### SQL Migration
Filename: `migrations/NNNN_description.up.sql` / `.down.sql`
```sql
-- Hypertable pattern
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my_table (
    time        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    account_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
    env_mode    TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbol      TEXT NOT NULL,
    value       DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL
);
SELECT create_hypertable('my_table', 'time', chunk_time_interval => INTERVAL '1 day', if_not_exists => TRUE);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_my_table_sym ON my_table (symbol, time DESC);
```

## Event Publishing Pattern
```go
// Define domain event (add to domain/event.go)
const EventMyThingHappened EventType = "MyThingHappened"

// Publish from service
s.bus.Publish(domain.Event{
    Type:      domain.EventMyThingHappened,
    Payload:   myPayload,
    OccurredAt: time.Now(),
})
```

## Gotchas

### TOML array-of-tables decodes to `[]map[string]any`, not `[]any`
`[[params.foo]]` in a spec TOML arrives in `spec.Params["foo"]` as
`[]map[string]any`. Parsers that type-assert only `[]any` silently return
empty and the feature appears dead at runtime (no error, no log). Accept
both shapes when parsing, and add a spec-loader test that loads the real
TOML and asserts the list is non-empty — hand-built test params go through
the `[]any` path and hide the bug. Also: flat keys placed AFTER
`[[params.foo]]` in the same file attach to the last array entry, not back
to `[params]`. Put flat keys first.

### syncMode bus + in-handler publish re-enters the same goroutine
In backtest, `memory.Bus` runs in syncMode — `SubscribeAsync` becomes
`Subscribe`, and after `FreezeHandlers()` the fast-path publishes directly
on the caller's stack. If a strategy inside `Instance.OnEvent` (holding
`inst.mu`) emits a domain event whose subscribers call back into the same
instance (e.g. `handleCopytradeExitRejected` → `inst.IsActive()`), the
inner call tries to re-acquire `inst.mu` and deadlocks. Make state read
by any reentrant path lock-free (`atomic.Pointer[...]` for lifecycle
worked well), and defer the inner `Instance.OnEvent` dispatch into a
runner-level callback queue drained by every handler entry-point AFTER
`inst.mu` and `r.mu` are released. See `runner_copytrade_reentry_test.go`
for the reproduction.

### Copytrade handlers must use `event.OccurredAt`, not `time.Now()`
`handleFill` threads the fill payload's `filled_at` into `instCtx.now`
correctly, but `handleCopytradeSignal`, `handleCopytradeExitRejected`,
and `handleRejection` historically used `time.Now()`. In backtest the
event bus stamps sim-time via `NewBacktestEvent` but wall-clock is
~months ahead — any strategy code comparing `sig.PostedAt` (sim) against
`ctx.Now()` (wall) sees tens-of-millions-of-seconds deltas and any TTL
check fires immediately. Use the `Runner.handlerNow(event, handler)`
helper (picks `event.OccurredAt`, falls back to wall-clock with a canary
log if the envelope is zero) in every handler that populates
`instanceContext.now`.

### Reconciliation gaps + multi-write sequencing for crash recovery
The execution path has three reconcilers — `execution.reconcileOnBoot` (DB
orders table), `positionmonitor.reconcileOpenOrdersOnBoot` (broker open
orders), and the WS `handleStreamFill` in-memory path. They cover disjoint
(broker-state × DB-state) cells; a crash between `broker.SubmitOrder` and
`repo.SaveOrder` lands in the uncovered cell (broker=filled / DB=no-row)
and the fill is permanently lost. When adding a reconciler, enumerate
which cell of that matrix it covers and confirm no cell is orphaned.
`backfillFromBrokerHistory` fills the last gap via the optional
`ports.FilledOrderLister` broker capability.

When the repo lacks a single atomic call for a multi-step write (e.g.
SaveOrder + SaveTrade + UpdateOrderFill), sequence the writes so any
intermediate failure leaves the row in a state an EXISTING reconciler
already heals. Concretely: seed the order as `status="submitted"` BEFORE
writing the trade, and let `UpdateOrderFill` flip it to `filled` last.
If SaveTrade or UpdateOrderFill fail, `reconcileOnBoot` finds the
non-terminal row and pulls fill state via `broker.GetOrderDetails` on
the next tick. Writing `status="filled"` up front would orphan the row
with no trade attached — invisible to every reconciler.

### Per-execution trade rows for multi-fill orders
Large orders split into N partial fills must produce N trade rows keyed
by `execution_id`, not one cumulative row. Writing one row with
cumulative qty + the last leg's ExecID loses per-leg price detail and
breaks under any OrderStatus/Fills race in the adapter — the 2026-04-24
SPY call incident landed a single `qty=1` row for a 34-contract fully
filled order because `tradeToOrderUpdate` read `t.Fills()[len-1]` while
`OrderStatus.Filled` was stale. Adapters must emit one OrderUpdate per
ExecID; execution writes per-leg via `RecordFill` (execution_id UNIQUE
dedups); `orders.filled_qty` is bumped via a monotonic `GREATEST(...)`
UPDATE with a `WHERE filled_qty <= $new` guard and CASE-based status
promotion. This makes the write idempotent under replay, out-of-order
delivery, and boot reconcile. The matrix is now four reconcilers:
add `reconcileFillsOnBoot` (via optional `ports.FillLister`) at fill-leg
granularity alongside the three order-level ones.

### Broker adapter: never derive terminal state from multi-source snapshots
When the adapter exposes both cumulative state (`OrderStatus.Filled`)
and per-exec state (`Trade.Fills()`), a single "terminal" OrderUpdate
that reads both is racy — ibsync can flip `OrderStatus.Status=Filled`
before the Fills slice catches up. Prefer per-ExecID events sourced from
one cache (`ib.Fills()` is authoritative, server-side), and treat
`OrderStatus.Status` only as the "label which leg is last" hint. Order-
level dedup keyed on `OrderID` (rather than `ExecID`) will silently
drop every leg after the first once ANY source emits a terminal — the
pre-fix adapter's `emittedDone` set did exactly this.

### `Instance.OnEvent` does not stamp `StrategyInstanceID`; only `OnBar` does
`instance.go`'s `OnBar` stamps `sig.StrategyInstanceID = inst.id` before
returning signals; `OnEvent` does not. Existing callers (`handleFill`,
`handleRejection`, `handleAuctionImbalance`, `handleTradeReceived`) discard
the returned signals, so the gap is invisible in practice. If a new
handler forwards OnEvent-returned signals via `r.emitSignal`, stamp the
instance ID post-hoc or `SignalCreated` events will have an empty ID and
the strategy-label metrics will bucket as `unknown`.

### `json:",omitempty"` does not skip zero-value structs
encoding/json honors `omitempty` only for nil pointers, nil maps,
empty slices, and zero primitives — not for zero-value embedded
structs. A field declared `Foo MyStruct \`json:"foo,omitempty"\`` will
always serialize as `"foo":{...}` with default values, regardless of
whether the parent ever populated it. The Phase-2 EntryGatedPayload
landed with this mistake on `AVWAPState` and emitted an empty stub on
every MACD block until simplify-pass review caught it. When a JSON
DTO has an "absent vs zero" semantic distinction, declare the field
as a pointer: `Foo *MyStruct \`json:"foo,omitempty"\``. Slices/maps
already work because their nil form is distinguishable from the
populated form. For `time.Time` and other concrete struct values,
the modern fix is `json:",omitzero"` (Go 1.24+), which checks
`IsZero()` rather than the `omitempty` empty-value rule —
preferred over pointer-fying when the field is value-typed
elsewhere in the codebase.

### Storage timestamp ≠ logical identity for cross-binary diffs
When two binaries (roth-server live + roth-server backtest) write rows
into the same hypertable for SQL diffing, the storage timestamp
column reflects event-creation time, not bar time, and the two
binaries skew it differently: live's `ts` is `time.Now()` at publish
(sub-second skew from bar close); backtest's `ts` depends on whether
`fastClockNano` was set before that emit batch (sometimes per-bar,
sometimes batched to a single nanosecond when the flush-style emit
fires after the per-bar set/reset). Either way, JOINing
live↔backtest rows on the storage timestamp column is fragile.
Always carry a logical bar-identity field inside the payload (e.g.
`BarSnapshot.Time`) and JOIN on `(symbol,
(payload->'bar'->>'time')::timestamptz)` — that field is stable
across both binaries regardless of how the storage timestamp
drifts. Caught during the parity-indicator-diag activation
(PR #18) when the smoke-test rows landed at run-time `ts` despite
roth-server calling `domain.SetFastClock` per bar.

### Builtin engine name vs TOML spec id on lifecycle payloads
Strategies hardcode their builtin engine name (`"avwap"`, `"macd"`) into
payload fields like `EntryGatedPayload.Strategy` because they don't have
access to their own TOML spec. The runner re-stamps the field at the
boundary in `instanceContext.EmitDomainEvent` using `instCtx.specID =
inst.configStrategyID()` set at every pool-Get site in `handleBarCore`.
When adding a new payload type that carries a `Strategy`/`StrategyID`
field, decide which side owns it: if the strategy hardcodes it, route the
emit through `instanceContext.EmitDomainEvent` so the override fires; if
the runner constructs the payload (e.g. liveness `RecordEval`), pass
`inst.configStrategyID()` directly. A mismatch silently breaks dashboard
joins on `strategy_signal_events.strategy` because rows for the same
instance get split between the engine name and the spec id.

### Aggregator flush cadence vs downstream evaluation cadence
An event-driven aggregator that batches output on a periodic ticker will
silently starve any downstream consumer that evaluates on every input.
`livedarkpool.Service` flushed closed 5m DP buckets on a 1-minute ticker;
the strategy runner evaluated each 5m bar within ~150ms of close. The
just-closed bucket only landed in the lookup cache up to 60s later, so
the runner's `dpSource.Lookup` for the bar it was evaluating always
missed and the dark-pool confluence factor scored 0 every time. Symptom:
DB had the correct buckets persisted, in-memory cache lagged by exactly
one bucket. Fix: push-emit on bucket transition — when a tick arrives in
a strictly newer bucket than `latestBucket`, drain prior buckets via an
optional callback installed by the consumer, and keep the periodic
ticker as a safety net for symbols that go quiet without a transition
trade. Same shape applies to any other roll-on-boundary aggregator
(formingbar, ibkr/bar_aggregator) if a consumer ever polls them at a
finer cadence than their flush.

### Session-anchored aggregator silently drops pre-anchor bars during warmup
`domain.BarAggregator.Push` rejects any bar where `bar.Time.Before(a.sessionOpen)` and bumps an `aggRejectedSessionOpen` counter — no log, no error return. Use sites that call `InitAggregators(syms, todayOpen)` then push pre-today warmup bars (e.g. `monitor.Service.WarmUp(800 1m bars)`) silently get every bar dropped at the aggregator gate. The downstream `s.calculator.Update(closed_5m)` is never called and the per-(sym, "5m") `symbolState` stays un-seeded — invisible until the first live close emits a snapshot with `ema9=0`. Mitigations:
- For warmup paths that span pre-anchor history, bypass the aggregator and seed the calculator directly from native HTF bars (`monitor.Service.WarmUpNative`).
- Or anchor the aggregator at the first warmup bar's date and re-anchor at session boundary (`Runner.WarmUpHTF` does this, but the constructed aggregator is per-call and discarded — runtime aggregators stay anchored at todayOpen).
- Don't trust "WarmUp succeeded" log lines as evidence of HTF state — they reflect the 1m calc only. Verify HTF state with parity-diag (`PARITY_DIAG_ENABLED=true`) showing the per-(sym, tf) snapshot has non-zero EMAs.

### `WarmUpNative` + `Service.WarmUp` aggregator path is a double-feed risk
Once `WarmUpNative` is the canonical HTF seed, the legacy `Service.WarmUp(1m bars)` path becomes a hazard for any bars the aggregator accepts (today's pre-boot 1m bars, anchored at todayOpen): each closed 5m bar emitted by `s.aggregators[sym:5m]` flows into `s.calculator.Update`, double-counting bars that `WarmUpNative` will also seed. Symptom (2026-04-28): monitor and runner_htf agreed on close-only fields (rsi/ema9/ema21/regime_score) but diverged on cumulative fields (vwap $1.50, atr $1.17, vwap_sd $0.66) at runtime — the calc state had today's session integrated twice. Fix: pre-mark the (sym, tf) slots `WarmUpNative` will handle (`Service.ReserveHTFNative`) before any `Service.WarmUp` call, and gate the HTF block in `WarmUp` on the reservation set. Aggregator priming (`agg.Push`) must still run so the runtime first-close has full bucket coverage; only the `s.calculator.Update(closed)` side effect is skipped. Symbols/tfs without a registered HTF strategy (no WarmUpNative call) fall through to the legacy seeding unchanged. Companion fix on the runner side: `Runner.PrimeAggregators(orbBars)` pushes today's 1m through `r.aggregators` without firing `htfCalc.Update` — the prior code (`Runner.WarmUpHTF`) used a throwaway aggregator and a guarded `WarmUpTF`, leaving the runtime aggregator unprimed and emitting a partial first 5m close.

### Captured closures shared across goroutines need their own state
`roth-server`'s sharded warmup called `makeSnapshotFn()` once outside the per-shard goroutine loop and passed the result to all shards. The captured `IndicatorCalculator` is not thread-safe, so concurrent shard goroutines hit `concurrent map read and map write` on its `states` map and the runtime panicked. Pattern: any factory whose return value is captured into a closure that goroutines invoke concurrently must either be called inside each goroutine, or the captured value must be explicitly thread-safe. Static analysis won't catch this — the panic is non-deterministic and depends on tick-rate.

### In-process backtest pollutes live parity-diag log if calc Label collides
A `/backtest/run` call creates its own `monitor.Service` via `bootstrap.BuildMonitor`, which calls `NewService` and sets `calc.Label = "monitor"` — the SAME label as the live monitor's calc. Both processes emit parity-diag rows into the same log file via the same logger, so `grep '"calc":"monitor"'` returns live + backtest emits intermixed. The backtest's calc has fresh state (no warmup), so it emits ema200=0, vwap=first-typical-price for early bars — looks like a divergence in live but is just a different process. `Service.TagBacktest(backtestID)` now also re-labels the calc to `"monitor_backtest_<id>"` so backtest emits are filterable. Lesson: any per-process diagnostic ID that appears in shared log output must be discriminated at the emit site; relying on `Label = "monitor"` being unique across all monitor instances was wrong.

### `time.Time` map keys include Location, so UTC vs local mismatch silently misses
Two `time.Time` values for the same instant compare unequal as map keys
when their `Location()` differs — the runtime hashes the wall+ext+loc
triple, not just the absolute instant. The DP aggregator built bucket
keys from `t.Truncate(5*time.Minute)` while the inbound trade timestamp
was in CDT (`America/Chicago`); the strategy runner queried with a UTC
bar timestamp. Diag dumped `latest=2026-04-27T10:35:00-05:00` and
`probe=2026-04-27T15:35:00Z` — same instant, different Location, no
match in `map[time.Time]*Bucket`. Fix: normalize to UTC at every site
that produces or consumes a time-keyed map entry (`AddTrade`,
`Snapshot`, `FlushClosed`, the consumer's `Lookup`). Equivalent rule
for any cross-process or cross-package time map: pick a canonical zone
(UTC) and normalize at the boundary; never trust upstream Location.

### Caches that return partial coverage as success silently truncate the answer
`SessionResolver.getBarsInRange` cached per-day bar slices and returned
whatever was in the cache when any day in the requested range hit —
even if other days in the range missed. Backtests that crossed a
weekend got Friday-only or Monday-only results depending on which day
was warm, and multi-anchor AVWAPs (`pd_high`, `pd_low`, `session_open`)
all converged to byte-identical state because each anchor replayed the
same truncated slice. Symptom: backtest reproduced live's narrow
behavior but the diag dump showed identical `vwap`/`slope`/`barCount`
across anchors that should diverge. Fix: track `allCached` across the
full range and only return cached data when every requested day was
present; otherwise fall through to the fetcher. General rule: a cache
read for a range is a hit iff *every* sub-key is present — anything
less is a miss, not a partial answer.

### Re-peg cancel/replace can race the original fill into a duplicate position
Exit-order re-pegging issues a `Cancel(old)` + `Submit(new)` pair, but
the broker can fill `old` after we requested cancel and `new` before
the cancel ack returns. Both fills then hit `insertFillLeg` and create
two separate trade rows for one logical exit, leaving `db_net_qty`
double-decremented (RIVN: SELL 47 at 18:30:01, REPEG SELL 47 at
18:30:12.281, both filled within 31ms; resulting `db_net_qty=-47` on a
position that was already flat). Fix: in `insertFillLeg`, gate exit
fills by current tracked position quantity — reject when
`legQty > pos.Quantity + epsilon` or when no position is tracked. This
is the only safe boundary because the cancel-vs-fill race is owned by
the broker and we never get a deterministic ordering from their async
acks. Same pattern applies to any cancel-replace flow: the application
must be idempotent against double-fills, never assume cancel won.

### Per-bar `ResetX` on runner state must be additive, not replace-from-scratch
`runner.resolveAIAnchors` originally built `merged` map from `r.anchorResolver` + AI's `resolved` only. In live, both layers return the full anchor set so `merged` was complete. In roth-server backtest, AI's fallback returns only `session_open` AND `r.anchorResolver` was unwired (roth-server set `SetAIAnchorResolver` but never `SetAnchorResolver` — half-wired runner). `ar.ResetAnchors(merged)` then dropped `pd_high`/`pd_low`, zeroed `CalcBarCount`, and `hasMissingAnchor` re-fired on the next bar — looping forever and pinning warmup state to 1. The symptom in `strategy_signal_events` is a single block-reason class (`bias`) dominating the distribution at counts that don't match live (2210 vs 0). Fix patterns:
- Seed the rebuild target from existing state first, then overlay each upstream layer in priority order. The merge becomes additive: anchors not re-resolved by an upstream layer survive across re-resolutions.
- Audit *each* entry-point's wire-up when the runner is shared across binaries (live, backtest, roth-server). A half-wired runner produces a degraded but non-error path that silently looks like a strategy bug.
- Include an interface accessor (e.g. `AnchorTime(name) (time.Time, bool)`) so the runner can read existing state for the seed without leaking concrete-type internals (`AnchorPoints()`).

### In-place slice filter mutates the caller's backing array
The idiomatic Go pattern `out := s[:0]; for _, x := range s { if pred(x) { out = append(out, x) } }; return out` is allocation-free but **silently overwrites the caller's backing array**. The returned slice is correct, but the caller's slice (same backing) now has filtered values in positions 0..len(filtered)-1 and stale-original values beyond. Any caller that re-walks the original slice after calling such a filter will read corrupted data (`warmup.filterRTH` is one example; `warmup.TrimWithBoot1` initially picked the wrong boot+1 bar because it walked rawBars after Trim ran). Fix patterns:
- Capture whatever you need from the original slice **before** calling the filter (`cp := rawBars[i]; boot1 = &cp`).
- Or have the filter allocate a fresh slice instead of reusing the backing array — accepts the allocation cost in exchange for caller-safety.
- The function-local view always looks correct because tests only inspect the returned slice; this bug is invisible to the function's own test suite and only surfaces at call sites that touch the original slice afterwards.
